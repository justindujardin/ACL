### Overview

The ACL project shares roots with the [Torque 3D](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D) game engine from [GarageGames](http://www.garagegames.com), but does provides only basic application specific classes, and a abstracted platform layer for interacting with basic OS systems such as the file system, dynamic libraries, and threading.

### Credits

ACL would never have been possible without all the amazing developers that have contributed to the Torque family of game engines over the years.  I am eternally grateful for all the hard work they have put forward to make this library so brutally good at what it does.
