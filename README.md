### <a id="overview">Overview</a>

Application Core Library is built from a stripped-down version of the utility classes used in Torque engines.  It does not include any windowing, graphics, or input code.  It includes only the basic cross-platform types and classes for building applications on top of.  The main function of the ACL is to provide a solid basis for developing applications in a cross-platform way.  In addition to the code reused from Torque, the ACL includes a generic C API plugin system, that can be used to implement dynamic library plugins.

### <a id="credits">Credits</a>

The ACL shares roots with the [Torque](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D) family of game engines from [GarageGames](http://www.garagegames.com), and as such, it would never have been possible without the many people who contributed to Torque over the years.  I am eternally grateful for all the hard work they have put forward, and how it has made this library so brutally good at what it does.
